# Identifying serious medical conditions

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Create devices that analyze exhaled breath and facilitate detecting medical conditions at an early stage. The devices are to be installed at workplaces, schools, stores etc. 


## Background

If you feel ill and need help, you seek medical attention. However: people suffering from a number of serious medical conditions, e.g. certain forms of cancer, donÂ´t necessarily feel "ill" until it is already to late for them to get successful treatment. These people tend to die whay to young. What if there was a way of predicting serious illnesses long before you even feel sick?

## How is it used?

Measuring the composition of exhaled breath gives us among other things a clue of the condition of our lungs, but it can also be used to predict serious diseases in an early stage. 

Therefore, devices that collect samples of exhaled breath are to be installed at different public locations, e.g. at schools, workplaces, stores, hospitals, trains, buses etc. When a person passes by, an exhaled breath sample is taken. At the same time, the person is identified using facial recognition, or when possible: the use of a credit card or an ID card. 

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
